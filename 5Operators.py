# Bitwise Operators
# Operator	Name	Description
# & 	AND	  Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |	    OR	  Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^	    XOR	  Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	NOT	  Inverts all the bits
# <<	Zero fill left shift    Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
